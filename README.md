# AI Enabled AR Based Furniture Portal
This project aims to enhance the customer experience of an e-commerce furniture website by implementing augmented reality for 3D models of furniture using machine learning algorithms. The website features various filters such as price range, low to high, etc., and different categories such as sofas, beds, chairs, tables, etc. It also includes three separate platforms for sellers, buyers, and an admin. The website includes an "add to cart" and checkout functionality, making the buying process easier for customers.Additionally, the website uses a pricing tool that suggests the sellers or retailers the price of the furniture article.
